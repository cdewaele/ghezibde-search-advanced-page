# ghezibde-search-advanced-page
[Webtrees](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) advanced search customisation module for [Ghezibde](https://www.ghezibde.net/genealogie/) online tree.

This module sets the default search to CONTAINS for both given name and surname (instead of EXACT), reducing the risk of not finding an existing individual and thus creating a duplicate.

## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cdewaele/ghezibde-search-advanced-page/releases/latest).
Unzip the package into your webtrees/modules_v4 directory of your web server.

Activate module in control panel.
